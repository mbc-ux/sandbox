# EF and WebAPI REST services.
traditionally i would have done a single commit to a separate (non "main") branch followed by a merge to main as to keep a proper workflow. that did not seem to be appropriate or required for this exercise.
Not much logic is included in the source at the moment hence no tests. the majority of the functionality is being handled by ef and webapi.
There could be some tests around ensuring a csv is being parsed appropriately and key integrity however this did not seem to be appropriate for the exercise given there are only a few lines of code there.
